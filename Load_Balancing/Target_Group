Target group : 
A target group in AWS is a collection of targets (Ec2 Instance , IP's ,Lambda, containers )
that load balancers sends traffic to 

Target group can be: 
* Ec2 Instances
* IP addresses 
* Lambda functions
* ECS tasks (containers)
* ALB 

Why do we need target Groups??
Because the load balancer itself doesn't talk directly to Ec2 
it sends traffic to a target group and the target group sends to the registered targets 

ex: 
ALB  →  Target Group  →  EC2 instances

1.Registered targets  
2.Health check setting
