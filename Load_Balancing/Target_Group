Target Group: 

What is a Target Group ??
A target group (TG) is a logical group where your load balancer forwards traffic 

Target group can be : 
*Ec2 Instances
*IP addresses
*Lambda funtions 
*ECS tasks (Containers) 
*ALB (for NLB and ALB chaining)

Why do we need Target Group :??
Because the load balancers itself does NOT talk directly to Ec2 
It sends the traffic to a target group and the target group sends  to the registered targets 

Example: 
ALB  →  Target Group  →  EC2 instances

What target group contains ??

A target group contains: 

1.Registered targets
EX: 
*Ec2 instances  
*IP 
*Lambda functions
*ECS tasks

2.Health checks settings 
  Each TG has its own health check 
  LB uses it to check wheather the targets are healthy or not 

3.Target type 
  Target group  can be  any of these types: 
Instances
IP
Lambda
ALB

   
Why Target Grooup are powerful :???
----------------------------------------
Because they allow you to: 
-- Use muliple targets groups with One ALB

Exmple: 
- /api/* -> API target group 
- /app/* -> Web App target group 
- /image/* -> Image target group 

-- Do Blue green Deployment 
-- Auto Scaling Integration 

Target groups are different for ALB VS NLB 


Load Balancer	   Target Types
ALB           	Instance, IP, Lambda
NLB	         Instance, IP, ALB
CLB	         Does NOT use target groups
