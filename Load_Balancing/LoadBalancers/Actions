1.Edit IP address type 
  Choose whether the LB uses: 
  * IPv4
     or 
  * Dual - Stack  (IPv4 or IPv6)
This decides  what type of IP the loadBalancer  listeners will accept the traffic from 

Example : If your  app must support IPv6 clients enabel  dual -stack 

2.Edit Subnet 
A load Balancer atleast require two subnets : 
This option allow you to 
* Add more subnets 
* Remove subents 

3.Manage Instance (For CLB)
You directly register with the LB

For ALB / NLB 
You don't see this option because they  use target group 
This actoin

* Attach EC2 instances to the LB
* Remove instances
* See which instance is healthy/unhealthy lets you to attach :

4. Edit health Check settings
   Health checks decide whether the LB  Should send the traffic to the target 
   YOu can modify : 
   * Path 
   * Port
   * Interval
   * Timeout 
   *Healhty / Unhealthy threshold 

5.Manage Listeners
  Listeners define protocol  + port on which LB accept traffic
Here you can :
- Add/delete listeners
- Edit rules
- Add SSL certificates (HTTPS)
- Configure forwarding to target groups

6.Edit the security Group (ALB onLY)
ALB uses SG because it works at Layer 7

Here you can : 
- Attach new security groups
- Remove old security groups
- Allow traffic (80/443)
- Restrict access

Example: 
Block public traffic and allow only CloudFront.

7.Edit the load Balancer attribute
  Attribute control the LB behaviour 
  Common attribute include : 
ALB : 
*Access Log 
*Connectoin draining
*Idle timeout
*Cross-Zone load balancing 

NLB: 
*Cross Zone load balancing
* Deletion protectio n
