Create Applicatoin Load Balancer
\_LoadBalancer Name : Must be unique  and cannnot be created once the loadBalancer is created 
\_Scheme            : 
                     \_Internet facing : 
                                        Serves internet-facing traffic.
                                        Has public IP addresses.
                                        DNS name resolves to public IPs.
                                        Requires a public subnet.
                      \_Internal : 
                                   Serves Internal traffic
                                   Has private IP address
                                   DNS name resolve to the private IP
                                   Compatible with the IPv4 and Dualstack IP address types

Load Balancers IP address type: 
                               \_IPv4
                               \_DualStack : Include IPv4 and IPv6 addresses 


Network Mapping: The load balancer routes traffic to targets in the selected subnets, and in accordance with your IP address settings.

LoadBalancer is specific to the VPC  and the  targets of the Loadbalancer must be hosted within 
this VPC   unless routing to Lambda or on-premises targets  or if using VPC peering  
\_VPC  ID: 
\_IP Pool : You can optionally choose to configure an IPAM pool as the preferred source for your load balancers IP addresses.
          Create or view Pools in the Amazon VPC IP Address Manager console .
\_Availability Zones and Subnets :Select at least two Availability Zones and a subnet for each zone. 
                                A load balancer node will be placed in each selected zone and will 
                                automatically scale in response to traffic. The load balancer routes 
                                traffic to targets in the selected Availability Zones only.
\_Security Group: A security group is a set of firewall rules that control the traffic to your load balancer.
                  Select an existing security group, or you can create a new security group
\_Listeners and routing: A listener is a process that checks for connection requests using the port and protocol you configure. 
                         The rules that you define for a listener determine how the load balancer routes requests to its
                         registered targets.
