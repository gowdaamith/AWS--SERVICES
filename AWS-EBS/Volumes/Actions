Detach a Volume: 
-------------------------------
You remove the volume from being attached to the ec2 instance 
After you detach a volume,you might still be charged for volume storage ,
if you no longer need the volume delete it to stop incurring charges 

You can detach the  root EBS volume ,But only when the instance is stopped
Some Ec2 instance use Instance store  (local NVMe SSD) as root volume  which cannot be detached 
Ex: i3,c5d etc

Forec detach : 
-----------------------------------
Force detachment of a stuck volume can cause damage to the file system or the data it 
contains ,Only use this option as a last resort to detach a volume from a failed instance
or if you are detaching a volume with the intention of deleting it 


Manage Auto Enabeled  IO
------------------------------------
 Auto Enabeled IO ,Automatically allow input /output on the EBS volume after AWS detecs 
an issue or complete a recovery 

Normally when AWS detect a volume problem (Like hardware replacement ) ,
it may temporarily disable I/O to protect your data 

If auto-enabled IO is ON, AWS will automatically re-enable the vvolume once the issue is
fixed  - no manual action needed 

If Auto-enabeled IO is OFF ,the volume  will stay "I/O disabeled " until you manually enable 

Resilience Testing 
-----------------------------------
These features are used to simulate failure on your EBS volume to test how your system  behaves under strss or fault 

1.Create experiment 
This option allow you to create a fault injection experiment using AWS FIS 
You can simulate failure on up to 5 EBS volumes in the same availability Zone 

Used for : 
* Testing applicatoin resilience
* Validating backup and recovery 
* Chaos engineering  exercises

Pause Volume I/O:
--------------------------------
This simulates a situation  where the volume stops responding 
What happens?
* all  read / write  operation  freeeze 
* Instance tries to access the volume but gets no reponse

This help to test : 
* Application behavior when disk becomes unresponsive
* Failover handling
* Timeouts
* Error recovery logic

Inject volume  I/O latecy 
--------------------------------
This simulate slow disk performance  by adding artificail latency 
Example:
* Add 100 ms delay to every disk read
* Add 200 ms delay to writes

Used to test how your system reacts when:
- Storage becomes slow
- Database queries take too long
- Application performance degrades

AWS fault injection service [FIS]
----------------------------------
This opens the FIS console wher you can run : 
*CPU stress
*Network outages
*I/O faults
*Ec2 Instance termination 
*EBS volume failure simulation 

This is AWS' Chaos engineering service
