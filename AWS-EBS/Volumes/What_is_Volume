Volume :   = BLOCK STORAGE  = HARD DISK 
In AWS ,a volume is a block storage attached to an Ec2 Instance  
It is the virtual "hard disk " of your cloud server 

1.EBS Volume
----------------------------------------
It is a network attached ,persistent disk of your Ec2 instance 

Key feature : 
*Data persistent even after the Ec2 instances stops or terminate 
*Can be detached  and reattached to another Ec2 Instance 
*Comes in different performance type (gp3,io1,io2,st1.sc1)
*Snapshots supported (backups)

Example of use: 
*OS disk (root volume)
*Application storage
*Database storage (because of high durability )
*Snapshots to create AMI's


2.Instance Store volume (Ephemeral storage)
----------------------------------------------
This storage is physically attached to the host machine (local NVMe/SSD)

Key features 
*Extremely fast (because it is local NVMe)
*Data does not persist when the instance stops, hibernates or terminates 
*Cannot be detached or moved
*Available only onspecific Ec2 instances families 

Example of use: 
*Caching 
*Temporary files
*Scrath space
*Data that can be regenerated 


Where do you see volumes?
When launching an Ec2 instance ,you see a section: 
Storage : 
- Volume 1 (Root)
- Add  new volume 

or when creating an AMI ,yousee 
* Instance storage 1
* Instance storage 2
* Root volume 
* Additional EBS volume 
These are simply disks attached to your Ec2 instance


How volume works with an Instance
-----------------------------------------------------
Every Ec2 instance must have at least one volume ,usually an EBS  root volume 
Example :
t2.micro
  └── EBS Volume (8GB gp3) → OS installed here

You can add more:
t2.micro
  ├── EBS Volume (8GB)
  ├── EBS Volume (20GB)
  └── EBS Volume (100GB)

for some instance type:
i3.large
  ├── Instance Store NVMe 1
  └── Instance Store NVMe 2
