What is a EBS SnapShat???
An EBS snapshot is: 
* A backup of an EBS volume 
* Stored in S3 internally [ YOu don't see it in the s3 directly ] 
* Incremental  -> After the first snapshot ,only chaged blocks are saved
* Used for disaster  recovery , cloing  volumes ,creating AMIs  etc


Example Explanation : 
------------------------------
Imagine your EBS volume is your laptop harddisk 
Taking a snapshot is like : 
* Taking a backup of all the files at this moment 
* if  something goes wrong ( delete files ,corruption ) You can restore everything using this backup 

Snapshot lifecycle POlicy 
-----------------------------
The snapshot lifecycle polic automatically creates snapshots 

* Creates a snapshots according to the schedule
* Retains them for x days
* Deletes old snapshots
* Saves storage cost and provide regular backups 

Why snapshot are important ??
*Protect you from data loss
*Easy to restore  (Create a new volume from the snapshot 
*Useful for cloning environment 
*Mandatory for backup in production 


Quick example : 

If your EBS volume is 100 GB and you take : 
*Snapshot 1 -> Store full 100GB
*Snapshot 2 -> Stores only changed blocks
*Snapshot 3 -> again only chaged blocks 

This saves cost and time
