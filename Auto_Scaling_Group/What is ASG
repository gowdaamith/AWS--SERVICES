What is a Auto Scaling Group ??
An autoscaling group is an AWS feature that automatically creates  ,deletes  or replace  
Ec2 instances  based on demand and health 

ASG = Group  of Ec2 instances that scale automatically 

It ensure : 
* There are Right number of Ec2 Instances
* Healthy Ec2 Instances
* Instances are created consistently according to the need 


Why Auto Scaling Group Exitss??
Because traffic changes
*Monitoring : Low traffic
*Afternoon : High traffic
*Night : Low traffic

Instead of paying for Instance 24/7 we use ASG ,which adjust the  number Instances automatically 

Key compnents of the ASG:
1.Launch Template 
2.Desired Capacity 
3.Minimum Capacity 
4.Maximum Capacity 
5.Scaling Policies

Simple summary : 

| Feature                | Meaning                              |
