Launch Template
-------------------------
A Launch template is  a reusable template containing Ec2 instance 
configuration such as : 
*AMI
*Instance type
*Security Group
*Key pair
*User data
*IAM role
*Storage
*Networking setting
*Tags 
*EBS configs
*Monitoring configs

It makes launching consistent ,fast,automated and version controlled

Why do we need a Launch template??
Because manually launching  Ec2 every time is slow and error-prone
Template allow:
*Auto scaling group
*Spot fleets
*Ec2 fleet
*Consistent environment creation 
*Versioning 
to use a standardized Ec2 setting

Launch Template  = All setting for launching an Ec2 instance  including the Advance section 


Launch Template versioning 
--------------------------------
Launch template support versions
ex:
*Version 1 -> AMIv1
*Version 2 -> Updated user data
*Version 3 -> New AMI + Bigger instance type

When autoscaling group or Ec2 fleet uses the template :
*You can choose the version number or latest version 

This enable the safe deployment ,rollback and controller updates
