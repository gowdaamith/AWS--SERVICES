Capacity Reservation
-----------------------------------------------
On-Demand  Capacity reservation (ODSR)  let you reserve Ec2  capacity  in a specific  AZ so that 
AWS guaranteee you can launch the instance you need 

Capacity Reservation  = Capacity Guarantee 
Not a pricing Discount 

Capacity Reservation  Pricing and Billing 
-----------------------------------------------
Billing Rule:
* You pay the on-Demand instance hourly rate for the instance types that the reserved capacity support 
* But you pay for the reservation whether the instance runs or not unless using saving s Plans or RI matching 

Exmaple : 
You create a Capacity Reservation for:
3× t3.medium in ap-south-1a

Even if 0 instances are running, AWS charges you:
👉 3 × hourly On-Demand price of t3.medium

Because those resources are locked for you.

Can i reduce the cost ???
Yes -saving plans or Reserved  instances  can cover the capacity reservation 
 - You get capacity guarantee 
 - You still get cost savings
