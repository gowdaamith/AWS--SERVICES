Capacity Reservation
-----------------------------------------------
A Capacity reservation guarentee  Ec2 capacity in a specific Availability Zones 
It does not give you discounts 
- it only guarentee capacity availability 

Think of it like: 
-------------------
Reserving  seats in advance so the compute capacity is always availabel when I need it 

There are two types of capacity reservation : 
1.On-Demand Capacity reservation 
*Guarantees compute capacity for any duration 
*YOu can cancel anytime
*Youpay on-Demand price for the instances that actully use the reservation 
*Capacity sits reserved even if you do not use it 

2.Ec2 Capacity Block for ML
*Only of GPU based ML workloads
*Reserved 1 to 14 days, or multiples of 7 days (up to 182 days)
*You schedule  them ahead 
* Very high-demand GPU clusters
*Charged Upfront for the block duration 

🟨 How ODCR Billing Works (VERY IMPORTANT)
⭐ You pay only when the reserved capacity is used by instances.
This is the most misunderstood part.

Example:
You create a Capacity Reservation for:

5 × m5.large instances

On-Demand price = $0.096 per hour

Case A ⬇
You run 3 EC2 instances inside that reservation →
You pay 3 × On-Demand price

Case B ⬇
You run zero EC2 instances inside reservation →
❌ You pay NOTHING (this is true since 2019 — AWS changed billing)

Case C ⬇
You run 7 instances, but reservation only holds 5 →

First 5 get capacity guarantee
Remaining 2 run normally without guarantee
Billing is always On-Demand rate


| Scenario                                   | Do you pay? | How?                              |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Capacity reserved but 0 instances running  | ❌ No        | No bill                           |
| Some instances running ≤ reserved capacity | ✔ Yes       | On-Demand price for each instance |
| Instances running > reserved capacity      | ✔ Yes       | Extra instances billed normally   |


 ODCR gives capacity guarantee — not discount.

You can combine ODCR with:
✔ Savings Plans
✔ Reserved Instances
to get discounted prices on top of guaranteed capacity.

 Quick Real-World 
--------------------------------------------
ODCR (On-Demand Capacity Reservation)
→ “Block a table in a restaurant for free.
You only pay if you sit and eat.”

ML Capacity Blocks
→ “Book the entire hall for 2 days.
You pay upfront whether you use it or not.”


 Why would someone use ODCR?
----------------------------------------------
During Black Friday / app launches → need guaranteed scaling
For DR (Disaster Recovery)
For regulatory requirements (banks, government)
Ensures capacity during region/zone shortages

 Why would someone use ML Capacity Blocks?
-----------------------------------------------
GPU shortages are common
Deep learning training needs stable GPU cluster
You book capacity exactly when needed
