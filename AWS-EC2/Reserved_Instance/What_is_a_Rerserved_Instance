What is a Reserved Instance  ?? Registration Fee + Discounted Hourly Pricing 
A Reserved Instance  is a billing disount you get from AWS when you coomit to using a specific
 Ec2  instancce for 1 or 3 year 

Important : 
A Reserved Instance  is NOT  an actual instance 
It is only a discount applied ot matching running Ec2 Instances

Why so people by RI's??
Because RIs can give up to : 
* 72% discount compared to On-Demand prices

How Reserved Instance Work??
You commit to AWS : 
1.For How long ? : you will use the instance
2.For what instance family ? : ex: m5.large,t3.micro
3.For what region ? : ex: us-east-1
4.For what tenancy ? : shared or dedicated 

Once you commit .AWS appplies the discounted rate to your matching instances

Example: 

You buy a 1 -year Reserved Instance 
*Instance family : m5.large
*Region: ap-south-1
*Tenancy: Default 
*Platform: Linux 

Now anytime you run an m5.large in ap-south-1
AWS automatically applies the RI discounted hourly price

Even if you launch multiple isntances the RI discounts  applies  to only one instance at a time 
because you purchased only 1 RI 

 Perfect Summary
✔️ You pay the RI commitment based on the payment plan
(All upfront / partial upfront / hourly)

✔️ When you run a matching EC2 instance, AWS applies the discounted RI price to your usage
✔️ If you DON’T run any matching instance
You STILL pay the commitment fee
(because you promised AWS you would use it)


You choose the payment options : 
All Upfornt: 
*You pay the full RI cost immediately  for the entire  1 or 3 years

Partial Upfront :
* You pay some money now and the rest hourly discounted rates through the term 

No Upfront 
* You pay nothing now ,but AWS charges you the RI discounted  hourly price every hour for the full ( 1 or 3 year)
