AWS automatically checks : 
  "Do you have a running instance  that matches  the RI properties??"
if yes -> AWS applies the RI discoutss  to that instance's bill 

Saving Plans are better for most users becasue they are more flexible .
RI's are only better when you wnat the absolute maximum  discount and you know exactly 
which instance type /size you'll run for 1-3 years


Purchase Reserved Instance 
-------------------------------

\_Platform : Linux or choose of your choice
\_Tenancy  : Default or Shared / Default
\_Offereing Class : Convertible or Standard or Any   
\_Term : 1 month to 12 month or 12 month to 36 month   or Any 
\_Payment option : No Upfornt or AllUpfront or Partial Upfront 

YOu can add the RI to the cart how much you want 
And 

Order it 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Standard Reserved Instance 
----------------------------
*High discount (up to 72%)
*Low flexibility  

This is the cheapest option but also the least flexible 
YOu must stick to the same: 
*Instnace family 
*Instance type
*Region 
*OS
*Tenancy 

You cannot change to a different  family 
You cannot sell after expiry ,but you can sell in marketplace while active 

When to choose??
If you are 100% Sure about the Instance type you will  use for 1 or 3 year 

Convertibel  Reserved Instances
---------------------------------
* Medium discouts
* Very High flexibility 

You can exchange them at any time for another RI with 
*Different instance family 
*Different instance size
*Different OS
*Different tenancy 
*Different region 

This is why they are called convertible 

But there is one rule 
>> You must exchange to something with equal or higher value 
(i.e you cannot downgrade to a cheaper RI)

When to  choose??
If you are not sure which family you may need in the future 

For example:

You start with m5.large
Later migrate to c6i.large
Later switch to r6g.xlarge

Convertible RI allows all these changes.
