Dedicated hosts
----------------------------
A dedicated host is a physical server fully allocated to you ,not shared with nay other 
AWS customer

YOu get: 
*Full contorl over physical CPU SOCKETS 
*Control over NUMA nodes
*Control over instance placement on the host
*Ability to use bring-your-own licenses like window server ,SQL server,Oracle using  per-core / per-socket licensing 

Think of it as a  AWS giving you your own hardware inside their data center 

Why dedicated hosts exits??
Main reasons : 
1.Licensing compliance  -Most important 
For software licensed per physical core ,per socket  or per host ,like : 
- Microsoft windown server
- Microsoft SQL server
- Oracle Database
- Some enterprise security tools

You need to know the exact hardware  you run on 
* On normal Ec2 instances ,hardware changes   -> licensing terms break 
* Dedicated Host gives predictabel hardware -> Licnese legally valid 


2.Regulatory  / Compliance  Requirements 
-------------------------------------------------
Some industries require 
* Single-tenant  hardware 
* No noisy neighbors
* No multi-tenant virtualization 

Dedicated host meet these standards 

Example: 
*Financial services
*Governament workloads
*HealthCare compliance

3.Work laod Isolation 
---------------------------------------------
No other customers share the hardware ,so : 
*Less noisy neighbor  risk 
*Increased security 


⚙️ What You Control Inside a Dedicated Host
You can:

Place specific EC2 instances on specific sockets/cores
Control how many VMs run per host
Use host recovery to migrate instances
Track licensing using AWS License Manager

AWS also provides:
Host ID
EC2 instance placement
Hardware specification
Sockets, cores, vCPUs mapping



✔️ When to Use Dedicated Hosts
-------------------------------------------------------------
Use Dedicated Hosts when:

🔶 You bring your own licenses (BYOL)
Examples:

- SQL Server Enterprise per-core
- Windows Server Datacenter per-core
- Oracle DB per-core licensing

🔶 You need hard isolation
- For compliance rules that do not allow multi-tenant servers.

🔶 You want deterministic hardware
For:

- High-performance workloads
- Low-level tuning
- Guaranteed CPU mapping
- NUMA aware apps

🔶 You need to use older, special OS
Like:

- Windows 2003
- RHEL with custom kernel
- Legacy appliances
- These cannot run on shared hardware.


❌ When NOT to Use Dedicated Hosts
Avoid Dedicated Hosts if:

- You don’t care about physical hardware
- You don’t have BYOL licenses
- You want autoscaling and elasticity
- Cost matters → dedicated hosts are very expensive
- In most cases, normal EC2 is better.
