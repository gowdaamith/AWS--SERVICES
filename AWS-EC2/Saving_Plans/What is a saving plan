What are AWS saving plans??
AWS saving plans lets you save money by commiting to spend a fixed amount per hour 
Ex: $5/hour for 1 to 3 year

You commit to money ,Not to  a specific Ec2 instance

AWS  will automatically apply discouted rate to your usage every hour until your commitment 
is used up

Example
------------------------
How this works : 

You buy a 1-year  Saving Plan with commitment of :
$5 per hour 
This means :
Every hour .AWs will give you discounted pricing  for your usage up to $5 /hour
If your hourly usage costs more than %5/hour ,the extra is builled tat normal on-demand rate


Another exmaple 
-----------------------
Case 1 — Your usage is $4/hour
---------------------------------------------
Your commitment = $5/hour
Your actual usage = $4/hour

AWS will bill:
$4 at discounted Savings Plan rate

You will still pay $5, because that’s your commitment
(The extra $1 is just part of the commitment — you don’t get it back.)

Case 2 — Your usage is $7/hour
----------------------------------------------
First $5/hour → billed at discounted Savings Plan rate
Remaining $2/hour → billed as normal On-Demand

So here your bill =
✔ Savings Plan discounted bill for $5
➕
✔ Normal On-Demand bill for $2
