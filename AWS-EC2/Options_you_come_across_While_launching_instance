The options you come across while launching an Instance:

1.Names and Tags
-----------------------------------------------
Name : This is only a label for identification .
       AWS stores it as  a key:value pair with Name as key and value as the instance  name 


Add Additional Tags : 
Tags : metadata attached to an instance 

Ex: 
*Environment: Dev/Test/Prod
*Owner =Amith
*Project = MicroServices

These Help in :  Biling ,Automation ,IAM permission, Organization 

2.Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image)
---------------------------------------------------
You can select a already existing AMI or create a new one :

AMI defines : 
*Operating system 
*Default user
*Preinstalled libraries
*Root volume type(EBS)
*Virtualization: HVM 

The AMI ID is specific to region 
If you change region -> AMI ID changes 

3.Instance types 
---------------------------------------------------
Instance type defines :
*CPU core
*RAM
*Network Bandwidth 
*EBS throughPut 
*Costs

4.Key Pair(Login)
----------------------------------------------------
This Key: 
*Contains private key (.pem) stored in your laptop 
*AWS  stores the public  key on the instance
*You ssh using:

>> ssh -i amithtest.pem ubuntu@public_ec2_ip

If you loose the ".pem" key you cannot SSH unless
*YOu use SSM session manager
*You attach  a new key manually 

5.Network Setting
---------------------------------------------------
VPC : You can choose the VPC of your choice or You can use the default VPC

It defines: 
*CIDR range 
*Subnets

This decides: 
| Setting | Meaning                               |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Enable  | Instance gets public IP → you can SSH |

Best practice:
Public IP ONLY for bastion or NAT
Others → private only
