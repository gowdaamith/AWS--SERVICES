What is Spot Placement Score ??
It tells you: 
  " If you try to launch these spot instances Now ,how likely are you to get stable 
    capacity with low interruption "

The score ranges from  1 [bad] -> 10 [Good]

AWS created this feature  because
Previously  Spot instance depend on the capacity pools and these pools vary by : 
*Region 
*AZ
*Instance type
*Instance size
*Architecture
*Number of instances requested 

Before this feature ,Customes had no idea wheather their spot request would fail or not .

Now you get real-time score that helps you pick :
*Best Region 
*Best AZ
*Best instance type
*Best fleet  configuration 

What does the Score actually check ?
Spot placement Score evaluates 
*Spot capacity availability  for your instance type
* Interruption rate
* Number of Instances you want
* Region and AZ competition 
* Your attribute -based selection flexibility 

What the score mean in real time : 
| Score | Meaning                                                                      |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 8–10  | Excellent Spot capacity. Very low interruption risk. Best chance of success. |
| 5–7   | Acceptable. Some interruptions but stable.                                   |
| 3–4   | Risky. You may face interruptions or failed launches.                        |
| 1–2   | Bad idea. Very likely that Spot capacity is unavailable.                     |

 Where Spot Placement Score Helps
✔ Choosing instance types
Choose more flexible types → higher score.

✔ Choosing region
Maybe us-east-1 has low score
But us-west-2 has 10
→ Better to launch in us-west-2

✔ Scaling decisions
If score drops → Spot availability is decreasing.

Calculation of the placement Score 

Spot placement score helps you to select optimal Region or Availability Zones to run 
Workloads  that can use multiple  instances

Here While calculating  the Placement socre you should specify things like

\_Target capacity : Set your total spot target capacity  in number of instances ,vCPU ,or Memory
\_Instance type requirement :
                             \_Specify instance attributes that match your compute requirement 
                             \_Manually select instance type 

If you choose the  1 first option then you should select : 
\_Then  minimum and maximum number of vCPU per instance 
\_Enter the minimum and maximum GiBs of memory in GiB per instance
\_Choose the CPU architecture

Additionally instance attribute if needed
