2.Picks the ideal size
3.Select the best Spot capacity  pool
4.Generate a recommended configuration 
5.Suggests the best allocation strategy 
6.Sets up target capacity distribution 
7.Produces a ready-to-watch  template

Why spot Blueprint is Important??
✔ Helps choose the best Spot pools

\_Network: Choose the VPC  in which to launch your AWS resources 
\_Auto_Scaling_Group  : Specify the size of the ASG by changing  the desired capacity 
\_Spot configuration  : We will select  the optimal instance type based on your application  resources
                        criteria for vCPU and memory 
\_Target Tracking scaling policy: Choose whether to use a scaling policy  to dynamically resize your 
                                   ASG  to meet changes in demand
\_Application loadBalancer : the blue print will create an applicationo load balancer  
                            - We should specify the Scheme and  port
