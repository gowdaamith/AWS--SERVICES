What is an Ec2 Spot Request ???
An Ec2 Spot request is a way to request Ec2 spot instances ,which are unused Ec2 capacity 
offered  by AWS  at up to 90% cheaper than On-Demand pricing 

But - These can be interrupted by the AWS at any time if AWS needs the capacity back .
AWS does this because ,Instead of wasting the idle servers ,AWS sells them at huge discounts
to the user's but without a guarentee   that you can keep them forever


The Most Important Rules of Spot Instances are :
Rule 1: AWS can stop your Instance with a 2-Minute Warning 
*AWS sends a notice throught :
  - A cloudWatch agent
  - Instances metadata endpoint
*After the 2 minutes  instances stops or terminate

Rule 2: You do Not control When  the interruption happen
Depends on region ,AZ,and instance type capacity 

Types of spot requests
--------------------------------
1.One-time spot request
*AWS tries onec to launch your spot instance
*If the price / capacity isn't available  -> request fails
*Best when you want a single instance quickly 

2.Presistent Spot Requests
*The request stays ACTIVE  even if the instance stops or is interrupted 
*AWS will keep trying to launch it again 
*Good for long-running workloads that can resume 

Spot instance lifecylce:
--------------------------------
1.You submit a request (choose type + max price + instance type)
2.AWS checcs if capacity is available 
3.If available  -> Spot instnaces launches
4.If not available -> requests waits in queue
5.If your instances is interrupted  -> AWS tires again [ if you selected persistent request ]

When to  Use Spot instances 
*Containerized workloads
*Big Data
*CI/CD pipeline 
*Machine Learning training
*Batch processing Jobs
*Image / video  rendering 
*Distributed workloads

Whenn NOT use the Spot instances
*Databases
*Stateful application 
*System requiring guaranteed uptime
*Production workloads where interruption is unacceptable
