Elastic IP 
-------------------------
An Elastic IP is a permanent public IP   addresss that AWS gives you so your instance can 
always be reachable from the internet even if you stop/start or replace the instance 

Normal Public IP = changes  when you stop / start the instance
Elastic IP = never changes 

Why do we need the Elastic IP 
Imagine this scenario : 
*YOu have a produciton web server server
*It is reachable  at 54.23.12.5
*You stop → start the EC2 instance

Normal Public IP would change → your website breaks.

But if you use an Elastic IP:
* You stop/start EC2 → IP stays the same
* Your website is always reachable

Key Feature of the EIP 
| Feature                                                   | Description                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Static Public IP**                                      | Permanently assigned until you release it              |
| **Re-mappable**                                           | Can move the IP from one instance to another instantly |
| **One EIP free only when attached to a running instance** | You pay if unused                                      |
| **IPv4 only**                                             | No Elastic IPs for IPv6                                

When the instance fail you move the EIP ??
>> EIP → from Instance A → to Instance B

This gives:
* High availability
* Fast failover
* Zero downtime

Billing: 
AWS charges for Elastic IP if:
* It is allocated but not associated with any running instance
* Or associated with a stopped instance

So: 
Unused EIP = Charged
Active EIP = Free
