Key Pair:
A key pair, consisting of a private key and a public key, 
is a set of security credentials that you use to prove your identity 
when connecting to an instance.

Key pair name: 
Key pair type : 
              \_RSA           Old classic encryption  algorithum  require large number key size (2048 or 4096 bits )
              \_ed25519       New modern algorithum ,Stronger security with much smaller keys (Only 256 bits )
Private Key file format:
                       \_.pem : for use  with OpenSSH 
                        \_.ppk : for use with puTTy

Security Strength :
| Algorithm             | Key Size   | Security                                       |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **RSA 2048-bit**      | Large      | Good (old standard)                            |
| **RSA 4096-bit**      | Very large | Very good but slow                             |
| **ED25519 (256-bit)** | Small      | Excellent (stronger than RSA-4096 in practice) |

✔ ED25519 is considered more secure against modern attacks
✔ RSA needs bigger keys to match ED25519 security

Speed (Performance)
| Task           | RSA    | ED25519       |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------- |
| Key generation | Slow   | **Fast**      |
| Signing        | Medium | **Very fast** |
| Verification   | Medium | **Fast**      |

✔ ED25519 is much faster than RSA
✔ RSA becomes slow with 4096-bit keys

Key size : 
- RSA-2048 key file ≈ 1.8 KB
- RSA-4096 key file ≈ 3.4 KB
E- D25519 key file ≈ 0.5 KB
✔ ED25519 keys are smaller, easier to store & transfer

Compatibility :
| Feature                               | RSA     | ED25519                |
| ------------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------- |
| Supports all old systems              | **Yes** | ❌ Sometimes NO         |
| Works everywhere (AWS, Linux, GitHub) | **Yes** | ✔ Yes (modern systems) |
| Very old OS (legacy systems)          | ✔ Best  | ❌ Not supported        |


✔ RSA is universal
✔ ED25519 is modern — supported by AWS EC2, Linux, GitHub, OpenSSH 6.5+
❌ Very old enterprise systems may use RSA only
