1.Edit the inbound rule
--------------------------
Inbound rules control the incoming traffic that's allowed to reach the instance 

Here we can edit the exiting rule or Add a  new rule 
Its just like add the inbound rule ,while creating  an Security Group 

2.Edit the outbound rule: 
----------------------------
Outbound rules control the outgoing traffic that's allowed  to leave the instance 

Here we can edit the existing rules or add a new rule 
Its just like adding the outbound rule .while creating an Security group 

3.Manage Tags 
----------------------------
Here we can add a new tag or remove or modify the existing tag

4.Copy to new security Group 
------------------------------
A security group  acts as a virtual firewall  for your instances to control inbound and 
boutbound traffic .To create a new security group  ,complete the field below 

This is used to use the already existing SG as a base for creating a new security group 

5.Manage Stale rules
--------------------------------
A stale security group rule happens when    your security group contains
a rule like this 
>> Allow inbound traffic from SG-abc123 (Security Group in another VPC)

But later : 
The VPC peering connection between the two VPC's is deleted 
or 
The referenced security group in the peer VPC  is deleted 

Now the rule is pointing to something that no longer exists 
That is what AWS call a Stale rule 

To resolve a stale rule, either remove it from the security group, 
or if rule is stale because the VPC peering connection was deleted, 
create a new VPC peering connection with the same VPCs.

6.Share a Security Group 
-----------------------------------
YOu basically saying : 
  "I give permission to another AWS account  to use this security group in their VPC "
This is doen using AWS RAM (Resource Access manager )

7.Delete the security Group 
-------------------------------------
Delete security group  is  Just deleting the security group 

8.VPC association 
----------- ---------------------------
YOu are loooking at a security group that was shared using AWS RAM , and it is not 
yet attached to  any  of your VPC  , "Associate VPC" links it to your VPC  so you can use 
it
