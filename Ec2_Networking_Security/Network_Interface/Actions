*Firewall applicatoin 
*Traffic inspection instance

10.Manage tage
   Add or edit tags for identificationo  and billing 

12.Manage Prefixes

14.Modify idle connection tracking timeout 
   This related to connection tracking for stateful flows 
  Where we can modify the :
   TCP established timeout
   UDP stream timeout
   UDP timeout

15.Create flow log 
Create a VPC flow logs for this ENI only 
Flow log track all network traffic : 


Flow log  settings:
\_Name 
\_filter: The type of traffic to capture 
        \_Accept
        \_Reject
        \_All
\_Maximum aggregation interval : 
The maximum interval of time during which a flow of packets is captured and aggregated into a flow log record.
   \_10 minutes
   \_1 minutes
Destination : The destination to which to publish the flow log data.

- Send to CloudWatch logs
- Send to an S3 bucket
- Send to Kinesis Firehose in the same account
- Send to Kinesis Firehose in a different account

Destination log group: The name of the Amazon CloudWatch log group to which the flow log is published. 
                       A new log stream is created for each monitored network interface.

Service access: VPC flow logs require permissions to create log groups and publish events in CloudWatch.
\_Use an existing service role
\_Create and use a new service role 

IAM ROLE  NAME : If the first option is choosen 
Service Role Name:  A new service role will be created with the necessary permissions to publish to CloudWatch logs.

Log record format:

16.Manage ENA express
Enable or Disable ENA express 

17. Manage ENA queue 
ENA support multiple trasmit / receive queues for high-speed NIC'S
You can : 
Increase queues (better performance)
Reduce queues (save CPU)
>> High-performance EC2 instances use >8 queues.
