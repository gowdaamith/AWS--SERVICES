An Elastic network interface is a logical networking component  in a VPC that represent 
a virtual  network card 

Details:
\_Description  : A description  of your network interface 
\_Subnet       : The subnet in which you want to  create a network interface
\_Interface type : 
                \_ENA  Elastic Network Adapter >> Standard high performance network interface used by most Ec2 instances
                \_EFA Elastic Fabric Adapter with ENA  >> EFA for hardware and ENA for capabilities (used for  HPC traffic via EFA  and Normal network Traffic via ENA)
                \_EFA only >>  only availabel on select specialized HPC or ML instances

Private IPv4 address: The private IPv4 address to assign to the network interface 
>> Auto-assign 
>> Custom 

Additional Setting : 

IPv4  Prefix Delegation
---------------------------
This setting controls whether  AWS gives the ENI a block of IPv4 addresses (a prefix) ,not 
just a single IP 

options
\_1.Do not assign 
  * No IPv4 prefix  will be atttached 
  * The ENI get only the normal IPv4 addresss 

\_2.Auto  assign 
  * AWS automatically gives a prefix ( like /28 -> 16 IPs )
  * Instance can use these IP's for containers ,pods ,apps ,etc

\_3.Custom 
  * You choose your own prefix size and IP block 
  Used mainly when :
  *Amzon ECS ,EKS
  *High-density networking
  *Assigning many IP's from a single ENI 

Idle Connection Tracking Timeout
AWS tracks connection flowing through the ENI 
if a connectoin is idle for too long  ,AWS removes it from the connection table 

This prevents : 
*Memory waste
*Stale connection 
*NAT exhaustion
YOu can configure this idle timeout 

TCP Established Timeout
--------------------------------
This is the timeout for a TCP connection that is established but idle 
Default 432,000 = five days

Meaning : 
If a TCP connection stays open but no packets are exchanged for 5 days , AWS conenction tracking removes it 
This avoids infinite idle TCP session 


UDP Stream Timeout
-------------------------------
UDP is connnectionless 
AWS treats a connection flow of UDP packets between two endpoints  as a UDP "stream " 

default : 180 seconds (3 minute)
Meaning : 
If a UDP packet stop flowing for more than  3 minute ,AWS assumes the "Stream" is  finished  and remove the flow  from tracking 

UDP timeout 
-------------------------------
This is the timeout for single or bursty UDP packets ,not continuous  streams
Default values : 

*UDP timeout  30 sec
*UDP stream timeout 180 sec

Meaning : 
If a single UDP request / reponse  is not followed by more packets within 30 seconds ,the flow is removed
