What is an ENI ?
An ENI is a logical network component in a VPC that represents : 
- Private IPv4 address
- Public IPv4 (optional)
- One or more IPv6 addresses
- MAC address
- Security groups
- A primary network card for the instance
- Elastic IP (optional)
- Network-related attributes (source/dest check, etc.)

 It is basically the identity of your EC2 instance inside your VPC network.

Why is ENI Important?
Because everything network-related in EC2 is tied to a network interface:

EC2 IPs belong to the ENI, not the instance.
If the instance stops → IP is lost (unless using EIP).
If the ENI moves → IP and network identity move.

ENI components :
An ENI cotains :
1.Private IPv4 address
2.Secondary IPv4s private address
3.Elastic IP (if attached)
4.IPv6 address
5.MAC address
6.Security groups
7.Description and tags
8.Attachment to an Ec2 Instance 

Key features of ENI
1.Attach / Detach 
*You can attach an ENI to another Ec2 instance 
*Helpful during failover or HA setups 

>> If you remove an ENI from an Instance it only losses it ability to commuicate but it will not stop or terminate 
>> You can attach Mutiple ENIs to a single  Ec2  , but the number depends on the instance type 
    - Multiple ENI are used for : 
       - High Availability  / failover
       - Segregate traffic  
              ENI #1 → Public subnet (internet-facing)
              ENI #2 → Private subnet (database traffic)
              ENI #3 → Security devices / monitoring
        - Different Security Groups  ,IP addresss ,Routing , FireWall rules 
        - Mutiple-VPC networking using VPC peering or transit Gateway 
             Some architecture use different ENI's to talk to diffrent network 
        - Hybrid or multi-NIC  application 
             Some workloads require multiple NICs:
               - Firewalls
               - Load balancers
               - NAS/SAN appliances
               - Network appliances

2.Multiple  Network Interfaces
  An instance can have more than ONe ENI 

3.Preserve Network Identity 
  If an Ec2 Instance fails:
*Stop the instance
*Detach ENI 
*Attach the ENI to a new Instance

Where is ENI used ??

✔ 1. Web Servers
Use ENI to keep the same IP when replacing instances.

✔ 2. NAT Instances
Instances in public subnet need multiple ENIs.

✔ 3. Firewalls / Monitoring Appliances
One ENI for incoming, one for outgoing traffic.

✔ 4. Multi-homed Network Designs
Instances with dual network presence (public + private).

✔ 5. Disaster Recovery
Move ENI from failed instance to standby instance.


Types of Network Interfaces
-------------------------------------------
AWS allows:

Primary ENI
- Created automatically
- Cannot be detached while instance is running
- Has the primary private IP

Secondary ENI
- Added manually
- Can be attached/detached anytime

Example 

🔹 You have an EC2 with ENI:
Private IP: 10.0.1.5
Security group: SG-1
EIP: Yes
MAC: Unique

If the EC2 becomes unhealthy, you detach ENI and attach it to a new EC2.

New EC2 immediately becomes:
10.0.1.5
Using same SG
Same EIP
Same MAC (important for licensing)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Type of Public IP           | Moves with ENI? | Stays with new instance? |
| --------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Elastic IP**              | ✅ Yes           | ✅ Yes                    |
| **Auto-assigned Public IP** | ❌ No            | ❌ No (deleted on detach) |
